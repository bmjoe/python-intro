# My First Project "Life length predictor"  

Based on first chapter of ["Automate the boring stuff with python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/)  
`mfp.py` takes your name and age then gives you a prediction of how much time you have yet.  

## Installation and use  
1 Copy [mfp.py](https://github.com/marysiuk/python-intro/blob/master/mfp.py).  
2 Run it in python 3.6.  
3 Have fun.  
4 Try to type fake age. For example the age of Jeanne Louise Calment.  
5 Have fun one more time.  
6 Accept my gratitude.  
7 Have a nice rest of your life.
